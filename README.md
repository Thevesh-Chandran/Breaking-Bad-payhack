  <h1>Swytch ‚Äì Pay Hack Hackathon Submission</h1>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Swytch</strong>, a smart financial solution built by <strong>Team Banking Bank</strong> for the <strong>Pay Hack</strong> Hackathon. This Flutter app is designed to make switching between payment modes seamless, secure, and simple.</p>

 <h2>üìÇ Project Location</h2>

<p>The Flutter project is located inside the following folder path:</p>

<pre><code>payhack/Swytch/swytch/</code></pre>

<p>To run the app:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Navigate to the folder:</strong>
    <pre><code>cd payhack/Swytch/swytch</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Install dependencies:</strong>
    <pre><code>flutter pub get</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run the app:</strong>
    <pre><code>flutter run lib/main.dart</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have Flutter installed and a device or emulator connected.</p>

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations</h2>

<p>While <strong>Swytch</strong> demonstrates our vision for a seamless smart payment system, the following features are not yet implemented due to development constraints and limited access to necessary APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Offline SMS-based payment</strong> ‚Äì Not available due to lack of integration with telco and banking infrastructure.</li>
  <li><strong>Local and international transfers</strong> ‚Äì These features require access to secure banking APIs, which we currently do not have.</li>
  <li><strong>Backend server</strong> ‚Äì There is no active backend server in this version to process:
    <ul>
      <li>Wallet or points balance updates</li>
      <li>User authentication or data storage</li>
      <li>Transaction history or syncing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All current features are frontend-based and demonstrate the intended user experience, but not full functionality.</p>
